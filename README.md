## Monorepo
Juggling a fullstack project over multiple repos is like trying to teach a newborn baby how to ride a bike.

BLThunderstorm follows a monorepo approach, all officially maintained modules are in the same repo.

The main reason why I think monorepo is good is that you don't have to create a GitHub organization/GitLab group just to make one project. You can do it on one repo and it will go easy with Vercel's free plan.

This approach is inspired by [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse), [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/), and others!
