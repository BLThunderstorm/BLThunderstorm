## FAQ

Soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

BLThunderstorm is way behind of something that can be called a "Minimum viable product" (MVP). The open alpha season will be focused on the core functionality and Battlelog games, but currently we're far way back due to bugs.

### Why the name "BLThunderstorm"?
BLThunderstorm is just a placeholder name, mate. If you want to propose a name for BLThunderstorm, or whatever it would be called in the future, go to this [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/BLThunderstorm/BLThunderstorm/discussions/53).
