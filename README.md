## Monorepo
Juggling a multimodule project over multiple repos is like trying to teach a newborn baby how to ride a bike.

BLThunderstorm follows a monorepo approach, all officially maintained modules are in the same repo.

This approach is inspired by [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse), [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/), and others!
