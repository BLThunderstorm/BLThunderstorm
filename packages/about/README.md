BLThunderstorm is an **unofficial** dashboard and stats-tracking site for Battlelog games.

BLThunderstorm is still work in progress and not production-ready.

## Codebases

As like other applications, BLThunderstorm have multiple codebases. To prevent things from cluttering up, BLThunderstorm was migrated from GitHub and was made a GitLab group.
