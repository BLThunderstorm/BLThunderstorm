## What is this?
This codebase is called Leningrad, it will be used for our backend server. We haven't worked on this and we haven't even decided what stacks to use yet but it will probably we are going to use Node.js + TypeScript + PostgresSQL + Vercel, unless serverless become impossible to be used for the backend like due to infinite scaling.
