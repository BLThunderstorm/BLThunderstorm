#### What's this

This package is named "Market Garden". It is named after, yup, [Operation Market Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Market_Garden), an unsuccesful military operation fought in the Netherlands from 17 to 25 September 1944.

This package is used for our Next.js frontend application. Built as a rewrite of the Stalingrad Nuxt.js frontend server.
